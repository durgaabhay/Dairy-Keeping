React JS based web application for user's personal journals.

Description - This is a graduate proposal project report to explore a UI framework like Angular/React/Ember and use its features to 
build a web application.This is a web application that records userâ€™s daily entries, allows users to add personal favorites etc.

A small demo of what the application can perform is available in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-rquOHr_xs&t=23s

Scope for improvement/Work under progress - 
(1)In future, the application is intended for users to upload photos too. Uploading and storing images can be 
achieved using amazon S3 which is Simple Storage Services.The user entries will be stored in the database. The current repository holds a 
Node JS API that handles uploading any image to Amazon S3 bucket. React needs to utilise this API to upload and view images.
(2)A weather portion that reads information from a weather api and mentions the current weather for the user.
